# ServiceNow

# Introduction 

## What is an instance?
When you are accessing ServiceNow, you are accessing an instance of the Platform. An organization can have several instances (e.g., Development, Quality Assurance (QA), Test, and Production) and each instance is a single implementation of the ServiceNow Platform. In this course, we provide a (simulator) instance for you to play around in the Platform as you go through each lesson.

To access the Platform, a user navigates to a secure, unique URL: `https//<instance-name-here>.service-now.com` from a supported web browser.

# Next Experience Unified Navigation

## All Menu

The All menu provides access to all applications and modules they contain. An application is a group of modules (or pages) that provide related information and functionality in an instance. For example, you'll work in the Incident application in this course, which contains modules for creating and viewing incidents. 



Selecting the All menu opens the Filter Navigator. Search for applications and modules using the Filter Navigator.

## Filter Navigator

The Filter Navigator is where you can quickly navigate to applications and modules. Simply begin by typing the application or module name (all, or part of, any module name). For example, if you were to search Service Catalog, you can start to type, "Service Cat" and all applications with the keyword will display.

## Pinning Menus

With Next Experience, when you select a menu, it will display as a temporary semi-transparent menu. If you want the menu to persist, select the Pin icon. This will place (pin) the menu to your content frame. You can also un-pin the menu by selecting the Pin icon again. 
NOTE: The position of the components on your screen may vary depending on your region.

## Customizing Favorites

Selecting the star icon next to an application or module will create a Favorite menu item. Favorites can be re-ordered, edited, or removed from the menu by selecting the Edit (pencil) icon. 
To re-order a favorite item, select the pencil icon first to edit it, then click and drag the item (or select the icon with six dots) to whichever order you'd like! 
To change the name, color, and icon of a favorited item, select the item and change one or all three options! 
While editing a favorited item, don't forget to Save your edits (select Save edits) before exiting the Edit your favorites window.

## History Menu

Select the History menu, then select any recent activity to open the item in the Content Frame. By default, the maximum number of items displayed in the History tab is 30. 
The system creates history entries for many types of content including lists, records, and homepages. Some content types are not tracked in the history, such as UI pages and other non-standard interfaces.

## Workspaces Menu

Agents, case managers, helpdesk professionals, and managers use workspaces to help find, research, and resolve issues. There are different workspaces for different environments. For example, Agents can use IT Service Management (ITSM) workspaces or Customer Service Management (CSM) workspaces depending on the request.

## Workspaces
A workspace is a suite of tools displayed in a single-pane view that help resolve customer problems and provide answers to questions they may have. Agents, case managers, help desk professionals, and managers use these tools to find, research, and resolve issues.

## Lists
The list view displays records from a table in the Platform. With personalization and filtered lists, you can easily locate records and view activity associated with those records.

## Forms
A form displays fields from one record, where users can view and edit the record data. The specific information depends on the type of record displayed. The form can also contain sections and Related Lists (records in tables that have a relationship to the current record). Easily access forms by using Global Search.
